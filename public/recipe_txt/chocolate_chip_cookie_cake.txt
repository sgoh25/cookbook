Ingredients:
1-¾ cups (210g) all-purpose flour
¾ tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened
¾ cup (165g) light brown sugar
¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
1 large egg
2-½ tsp vanilla extract
1-½ cups (270g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, plus more for sprinkling


Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter or spray a 9-inch round cake pan with baking spray.
In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt.
In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until smooth. Add sugars and beat on medium speed until smooth and well combined, about 2 minutes. (You don’t want to beat the mixture until very light and fluffy like you would for a cake because the air will make the cookie too crumbly and puffy.)
Add the egg and vanilla. Beat until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. While mixing on low speed, add the flour and beat just until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.
Press the cookie dough into an even layer in the prepared cake pan. Sprinkle with more chocolate chips if desired.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the cookie is lightly browned and appears dry on the surface. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

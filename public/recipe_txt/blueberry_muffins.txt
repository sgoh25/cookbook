Ingredients:
½ cup softened butter
1-¼ cups sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups flour
½ tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
½ cup milk
2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over
3 tsp sugar


Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Cream the butter and 1-¼ cups sugar until light.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.
Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
Crush ½ cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in the remaining whole berries.
Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with batter.
Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons sugar over the tops of the muffins, and bake at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.
Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store, uncovered, or the muffins will be too moist the second day.

Makes 12 Servings


Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
½ cup butter
¾ cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2-⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas (~4-5 bananas)


Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. 
In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. 
Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. 
Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Fold in additional toppings, if desired. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.

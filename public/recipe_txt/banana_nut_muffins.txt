Makes 15 Servings


Ingredients:
½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
⅔ cup light brown sugar, lightly packed
2 large eggs
2 cups mashed very ripe bananas (about 3-4 bananas)
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1-¾ cups all purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ cup chopped nuts (walnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans or hazelnuts)
¼ cup brown sugar
2-3 Tbsp chopped nuts


Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl, whisk melted butter and brown sugar until well combined, about 1 full minute.
Add eggs, mashed banana and vanilla, whisking until combined.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and use a rubber spatula to lightly stir the batter until almost combined.
Add ½ cup nuts and stir until no streaks of flour remain. Be careful not to over-mix.
Grease 15 standard-sized muffin cups and divide the batter evenly among the cups. 
Sprinkle the top of each cup with brown sugar and chopped nuts (topping).
Bake for 18-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool.

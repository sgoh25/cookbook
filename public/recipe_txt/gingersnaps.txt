Ingredients:
¾ cup butter, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
¼ cup unsulphured molasses
1 egg
2 tsp baking soda
½ tsp kosher salt
1-½ tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 cups all purpose flour
2 Tbsp granulated sugar for rolling


Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar together on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add in the molasses, egg, baking soda, salt, ginger, and cinnamon. Mix for another 1 minute, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary.
Turn the mixer to low and add in the flour. Mix until just combined.
Place the remaining sugar in a small bowl, set aside.
Using a medium (2- tablespoon sized) cookie scoop portion out dough. Roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in the sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheet 2- inches apart.
Bake for 12-14 minutes until the edges are lightly golden and appear “crinkly”.
Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.

    "Ingredients": [
        "1-\u00be cups (210g) all-purpose flour",
        "\u00be tsp baking soda",
        "\u00bd tsp salt",
        "\u00bd cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened",
        "\u00be cup (165g) light brown sugar",
        "\u00bc cup (50g) granulated sugar",
        "1 large egg",
        "2-\u00bd tsp vanilla extract",
        "1-\u00bd cups (270g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, plus more for sprinkling"
    ],
    "Directions": [
        "1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter or spray a 9-inch round cake pan with baking spray.",
        "2. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt.",
        "3. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until smooth. Add sugars and beat on medium speed until smooth and well combined, about 2 minutes. (You don\u2019t want to beat the mixture until very light and fluffy like you would for a cake because the air will make the cookie too crumbly and puffy.)",
        "4. Add the egg and vanilla. Beat until well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. While mixing on low speed, add the flour and beat just until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.",
        "5. Press the cookie dough into an even layer in the prepared cake pan. Sprinkle with more chocolate chips if desired.",
        "6. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the cookie is lightly browned and appears dry on the surface. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack."
